Mentoring a group of students always comes with the possibility of having some students fall behind with progress and others being on par.As a mentor your responsibility lies with ensuring that at the end of the course /bootcamp every students completes his or her tasks  and eventually graduates from the program.
In  the Hypothetical situation presented ,we will have to Implement this intervention plan::                                                                                  1.Firstly the mentor would have to check and assess the previous submitted work for the students that have fallen behind.This would be to try and determine if the fall back has been caused by lack of commitment (IF ANY)  from the students that are behind,or see if any other reason can be come apparent by assesing the students work.Maybe it could be lack of grasping of basics principles.                                                                                                                                     2.The next step would be to talk each one of the fallen behind students,firstly kindly get them to talk why they think thye are falling behind ,maybe your style of mentirship is too fast or complicated for them.Try to find out if they have personal problem or maybe other commitments.                                                                 3.After gathering what the problem are the mentor would then create a daily extra sessions for the students and 24/7 active line support for the students to get them to catch up wiith the rest of the group.                                                                                                                                               4.The mentor would make sure to continue with  planned schedule ,not as to keep the students who are on track to get bored and lose their focus on the course.                                                                                                                                                                       5.The next step would be to encourage all the students in the group to feeel free to halt you as a mentor if they feel they do not understand some concepts ,so thay you can be able to fully explain to them before they even fall back onthe curriculum.
