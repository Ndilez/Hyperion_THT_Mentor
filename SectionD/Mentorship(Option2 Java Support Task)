To assist a Student in resolving an error in his Java code would involve the mentor implementing the following steps to the very last detail.The steps and plan to assist the student is outltined below                                                                                                                                                                           -Firstly get more information from the student,about what the error message is(If Any) and get the details of the error message ,wether it throws any excpetion and or tells us which line or module the error emanates from.You can also ask for the source code.                                                                                                                                                                           -after getting all the information,the next step would be try and run the provided code your self so that you are able to try and reproduce the code.After reproducing the code the mentor can use a automatic debugger,Like inserting a breakpoint in the code just before the line where the error is thrown and step through the code manully while observing the local varibles so that ,we can figure out what actual causes the error.If I cant reproduce the error I could get more information from the student on what O.S and environment they are using.                                                                                                                                                                          -Once the error has been reproduced it would be easier either using trace table and or debuggers to identfy the cause of the error,fix the error.I would then get back to the student share the fixed code and calmly explain to them the cause of the error and further advise them on how to better avoid such errors going forward.
